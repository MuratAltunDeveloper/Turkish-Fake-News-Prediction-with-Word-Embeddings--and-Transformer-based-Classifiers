 In recent times, the widespread dissemination of fake news through
 various information-sharing platforms, such as social media and other channels
 on the internet, has become a significant and growing problem. This issue has
 underscored the necessity for automatic detection of fake news using artificial
 intelligence-based solutions, which has emerged as a critical research area,
 especially when considering the extensive social impact that fake news can
 have. In this study, we address this need by performing fake news classification
 through the application of natural language processing and deep learning
 techniques on a newly created fake news dataset, TurkishNewsCorpus, which
 has been compiled from Turkish news websites on the internet. The
 effectiveness of different methods, including TF-IDF and fastText word
 embeddings-based feedforward neural network models, the fastText
 classification model, and BERT and DistilBERT transformers, is investigated.
 Following comprehensive experiments, a Turkish fake news classification
 model with an impressive 99% F1-score in classification performance was
 achieved.
